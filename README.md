## A Freecycle search tool

The existing freecycle UI is difficult to use and the search function does not work propertly. Additionally some locations are covered by multiple groups, and you need to search each one individually. scrapecycle allows accurate product searches accross multiple groups, and allows alerts to be set up for new matching posts.

UPDATE: The Freecycle UI has completely changed and the search function is vastly improved! This was the reason behind creating scrapecycle and therefore it wont be updated to the new layout
